# Transport Simulation

This MATLAB code simulates a transport scenario where agents move cargo to a delivery location within a defined field. The simulation visualizes the agents and cargo movements on a grid.

## Usage

1. Run the simulation script in MATLAB:
    ```matlab
    Transport_simulation
    ```

2. The simulation will start and visualize the movement of agents and cargo on the grid.

## Simulation Details

- **Field Settings:** The simulation defines a field with a specific size where agents and cargo move.
- **Agents and Cargo:** Agents are initialized at specific locations and can carry cargo. 
- **Movement Logic:** The agents follow a defined set of rules to move cargo towards the delivery location while avoiding collisions and staying within the field boundaries.
- **Delivery Location:** The target location for the cargo is updated dynamically based on the simulation's progress.
